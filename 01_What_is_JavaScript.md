# 🌐 JavaScript – 5W1H Notes

## 🧩 Topic: What is JavaScript?

---

### ❓ **What**
JavaScript is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, and **dynamic programming language** primarily used to make **web pages interactive**.  
It runs directly in the **browser** (client-side) and can also run on the **server** using **Node.js**.

🧠 In simple terms:  
> HTML defines the structure, CSS defines the style, and **JavaScript defines the behavior** of a webpage.

---

### 💡 **Why**
We use JavaScript to:
- Add **interactivity** (e.g., buttons, animations, form validations).  
- **Manipulate HTML & CSS** dynamically (using the **DOM**).  
- Build **modern web apps** using frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue**.  
- Handle **API requests** for real-time data updates.  
- Enable **backend development** with Node.js.

🚀 Without JavaScript, websites would be **static and non-interactive**.

---

### 🕒 **When**
JavaScript is used:
- **During client-side execution** when the user interacts with the web page.  
- **During server-side execution** when handling requests, database operations, or APIs.  
- **Throughout development**, from UI interactions to backend logic in full-stack applications.

---

### 📍 **Where**
JavaScript runs:
- **In browsers** – Chrome (V8 engine), Firefox (SpiderMonkey), Safari (JavaScriptCore).  
- **On servers** – Using **Node.js** or **Deno**.  
- **In mobile & desktop apps** – via frameworks like **React Native** and **Electron**.

🌍 JavaScript is **everywhere** — browser, server, mobile, IoT, even AI tools.

---

### 👨‍💻 **Who**
- **Developers** use JavaScript to build interactive and full-stack applications.  
- **JavaScript Engine** (like Google’s **V8**) executes JS code line by line.  
- **Users** indirectly trigger JavaScript by interacting with the UI (clicks, inputs, scrolls).

---

### ⚙️ **How**
JavaScript code can be written:

#### 1️⃣ Directly inside HTML:
```html
<script>
  document.write("Hello, Vineeth!");
</script>
```

#### 2️⃣ Externally in a `.js` File

You can write your JavaScript code in a separate file (for better structure and reusability).

### 📁 Example: `script.js`
```javascript
// script.js
console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!");
```

| **What**     | JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamic programming language for web interactivity. |
| **Why**      | It adds life and interactivity to otherwise static web pages.                                    |
| **When**     | Used during both client-side and server-side execution phases.                                   |
| **Where**    | Runs in browsers, servers, mobile, and desktop environments.                                     |
| **Who**      | Developers write JS; engines like V8 execute it.                                                 |
| **How**      | Written inside `<script>` tags or `.js` files and executed by the JS engine.                     |
